What's the idea here?

* Simulation to test a hypothesis.  Given a MODEL of the world, if we are trying to explain something, and no
existing rules satisfy the problem, the SPECULATE a new rule.  Then, use SIMULATION as a means of establishing
the likelihood that the new rule is compatible with the MODEL as we know it today. If the new rule is
"compatible enough" insert it into the MODEL and move forward. Remove the rule later if it is specifically
invalidated.

Note: what kind of simulation lets us do this? Numerical only, with something like a Monte Carlo
approach, or do we need discrete event simulation, or "other"? Or some combination of all of the
above.
